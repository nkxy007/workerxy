## 📡 Headless & Remote Communication

Decoupled communication system for remote agent interaction via Discord and RabbitMQ.

| Component | Description | Launch Command |
|---|---|---|
| **Discord Bot** | Bridges Discord messages to RabbitMQ | `python net_deepagent_cli/communication/discord_bot.py` |
| **Headless Agent** | Processes jobs from RabbitMQ (Worker Mode) | `python net_deepagent_cli/headless.py` |
| **RabbitMQ Broker** | Reliable message delivery between bot and agent | `sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server` |

### Key Features:
- **Mention-to-Job**: Mentioning the bot on Discord automatically creates a job for the agent.
- **Automatic Replies**: The agent's final textual response is automatically sent back to the Discord channel where it was mentioned.
- **Channel Routing**: Supports routing messages to specific channels by name (e.g., `Network-jobs`).
- **Structured Logging**: All activity (screen + file) is logged to `logs/communication.log`.
- **Worker Mode**: `headless.py` allows the agent to run 24/7 as a background worker without a terminal UI.

### ⚡ Topic-Drift Detection & Interaction Association

When started with `--automatic-context-detection`, the agent monitors your questions for two things:

1.  **Topic Drift**: If it detects a significant shift in topic (e.g., from BGP troubleshooting to AWS lambda functions), it suggests starting a new session.
2.  **Interaction Association**: If you refer to past work (e.g., "remember that BGP issue from yesterday?"), it searches your recent sessions (default 5-day window) and offers to resume the relevant one automatically.

- **Sensitivity**: Adjust drift sensitivity via `/session threshold <0.0-1.0>`.
- **Lookback**: Adjust association window via `/session window <days>`.
